The lawsuit is based on confidential material not yet available to the public, but documents made public by former Meta employees reportedly show that the company purposely made its platforms addictive to children and teens. The lawsuit argues that Meta's platforms have harmed young people's physical and mental health, including their ability to get adequate sleep, and that the company failed to disclose the harm or make meaningful changes to minimize it. However, it is noted that the harm lies in how teens use the platforms, what they view, and other mental health risk factors they may have.

The average large-cap fund is currently below the weight of the top-performing technology stocks, known as the \"Magnificent Seven\", which include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. The strong performance of these stocks has dragged down mutual fund performance, and if the trend continues, mutual fund managers could face concentration risks. Despite portfolio managers increasing their exposure to these stocks, diversification requirements limit their ability to match the benchmark weight. Goldman Sachs believes that if their macro forecasts for 2024 are realized, the tech stock group will continue to outperform, but there are potential risks to their continued success, including elevated positioning and high expectations around artificial intelligence.",

With 20-25% of enterprises already using RCS, the industry anticipates a shift of 25-30% of SMS volumes to RCS over the next 18-24 months. The platform's regulatory alignment and lower expenses contribute to its appeal for businesses. RCS faces challenges in terms of reach, as it requires activation by smartphone makers and is not supported on iPhones.

The lawsuit focuses on Meta's alleged prioritization of growth over the well-being of teenagers and claims that the company's internal documents show a profit-centered mindset. The attorneys general argue that Meta's lax approach to enforcing age restrictions leads to the unauthorized collection of data from underage users. While the arguments regarding children under 13 are legally sound, those regarding teenagers aged 13 and above are less likely to succeed. The article suggests that legislative action should be taken to address the excessive use of social media by young people while carefully considering First Amendment rights and avoiding broad liability on platforms. Measures such as automatic alerts and greyscale mode could encourage healthier behavior, but they should be supported by scientific research and go beyond legal requirements.

            "data": "Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge signals desire to regulate Meta under the Online News Act, addressing loopholes allowing news sharing on Facebook and Instagram. Meta blocked news to avoid Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission regulation but faces challenges as users find alternative sharing methods. St-Onge supports CRTC intervention, awaiting full law enforcement on Dec. 19. The law aims to facilitate fair agreements between Canadian news organizations and major online platforms, currently applicable to Google and Meta. Google negotiated a $100 million yearly deal, while Meta insists on ceasing news availability in compliance with the law. Meta fixed a bug allowing news content on Instagram but maintains private messaging services exemption. CRTC may assess Meta's compliance with the Online News Act. Despite concerns, addressing Meta might not be a government priority. The CRTC plans to establish a negotiation framework and launch a public consultation when the law takes effect later this month.",

Meta has already faced scrutiny over child safety and is currently being sued by the New Mexico Attorney General. Critics argue that encryption will make it harder to monitor and report instances of child sexual abuse material being distributed on the platforms. However, Meta defends the move, stating that it has implemented other safety measures and is developing machine learning technology to detect potential predators.

Meta's Reality Labs unit, focused on VR and augmented reality (AR) technologies, reported a $3.7 billion loss in Q3. The company hopes the Quest 3 VR headset will attract developers, but challenges persist in making VR mainstream. Apple's entry into the VR market with the Vision Pro headset, priced at $3,499, is anticipated to bring attention and competition in 2024, potentially impacting Meta's position. The enterprise VR market, particularly for workforce training, presents opportunities for Meta's Quest 3.",

While Meta dominates in personalized advertising and social media interaction, IBM is strengthening its position in AI and hybrid cloud domains.

Longer Reels, over 90 seconds, have double the median video views compared to TikTok. Reels outshine Instagram's Stories, delivering six times the reach. Emplifi suggests incorporating more Reels in social marketing plans for 2024. Despite this, advertisers posted five times as many Stories as Reels in 2023, emphasizing the need for a shift in advertiser behavior to capitalize on Instagram's potential. Emplifi's CMO, Zarnaz Arlia, highlights untapped opportunities for brands embracing Instagram's video strategy, emphasizing the importance of producing entertaining and valuable content to engage audiences. Consumers increasingly spend time on social videos, with a 15% increase over three years, making it a crucial format. While video length matters on Instagram, it's less critical on TikTok. Instagram Reels with longer lengths significantly outperform TikTok, with Instagram's push to prioritize Reels contributing to the substantial difference in views. Facebook Reels mirrors Instagram's success, attracting over three times the median views of other video content on the platform.",

These cuts raise concerns about the impact on diversity in the tech industry, especially as it undergoes a major shift toward artificial intelligence.

Meta's Threads platform recently announced its intention to become part of the Fediverse, using the same standard protocol as Mastodon, and embracing the decentralized approach of the internet's future. The advantages of the Fediverse include redundancy and resilience, interoperability, user privacy, and a lack of targeted advertising. However, challenges include fragmentation, varying moderation policies, scalability, and a smaller network effect compared to centralized social networks. The adoption of Threads into the Fediverse is seen as a validation of the movement towards decentralized social media and may pressure larger platforms to provide better, less exploitative services.",

The erosion of social media guardrails and the rise of generative artificial intelligence tools make it easier to spread misinformation, influencing voters and potentially causing election-related violence. The use of deepfakes, manipulated images and videos, could mislead voters and create a wave of misinformation. Social media companies, with relaxed policies and fewer content moderators, may struggle to prevent the spread of false information. The influence of former President Donald Trump, who continues to propagate unsupported claims of election fraud, further adds to the risk of election-related violence.

            "data": "A new law in Ohio that would have required children to obtain parental consent before using social media apps has been challenged in court. The law, part of the state's budget bill, was signed into law last July but has been blocked pending a court hearing next month. Tech trade group NetChoice, which represents companies like TikTok, Snapchat, and Facebook's Meta, filed a lawsuit against the law, arguing that it violates free speech and is overly broad and vague. NetChoice has previously won lawsuits against similar restrictions in Arkansas and California. It is unclear how the case will play out, but experts suggest that regardless of the outcome, other states are likely to introduce similar laws to address children's access to social media. Some experts argue that parental involvement and awareness are more effective than legal restrictions in protecting children online.",

The lawsuit alleges that Meta failed to remove instances of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) reported on Instagram and Facebook, while internally, the company recognized the severity of the child safety issue and had ambitious plans to become the leading messaging app for children. The unsealed documents estimate that 100,000 children per day were being sexually harassed on Meta platforms, and that Instagram had twice as much grooming as Facebook. Meta has faced criticism for not sufficiently moderating CSAM, despite its large number of reports to the NCMEC, and is also facing another lawsuit related to the impact of its platforms on children's mental health.",
