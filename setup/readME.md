# This is the setting up for the project, mainly including only-run-once-program, data pre processing, etc

# What I did for data pre process
1. Get the data with next integer times of 5 min time stamp
2. see how many of is not happened during with market data (more than half), since I also input the delay time, this is OK
3. clean the ones with no market data (too new)
